*(for Beat Saber 1.30)*

- Update for Beat Saber 1.30
- Allow sabers to only show in HMD (thanks to @ModdingPink)
- Migrated to AssetBundleLoadingTools (for safe bundle loading and SPI shader replacement)
- Fixed error when going into settings without any saber selected

*this is just a small update for bug fixes in 2.x.x, v3 is still being developed in parallel*  
*Needs `BeatSaberMarkupLanguage`, `SiraUtil`, `CameraUtils` and `AssetBundleLoadingTools` (available on ModAssistant)*
