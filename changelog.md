*(for Beat Saber 1.28)*

- Add support for consistent trail movement with player offset changes in noodle maps (don't stretch trail when player moves)

*this is just a small update for bug fixes in 2.x.x, v3 is still being developed in parallel*  
*Needs `BeatSaberMarkupLanguage` and `SiraUtil` (available on ModAssistant)*
